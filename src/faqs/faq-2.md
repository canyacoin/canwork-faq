---

CANwork only takes 1% in service fees when you make a transaction. This means that when you receive payment for your work, you take more of your hard earned salary home. You can expect high quality providers from CANwork. 

This because all of our providers are hand picked and vetted for their skills. CANwork is decentralised - CANWork does not and will never keep or distribute your personal data. CANwork provides fantastic utility for the many unbanked agents in the developing world. 

Cryptocurrency payments allow for international transactions to be processed quickly and with less fees. Payments on CANwork are enabled for use globally. Those in countries where paypal is not available donâ€™t have to worry when using our platform because our transactions are all made using cryptocurrency. 

National currency such as USD and AUD transactions coming soon. CANwork has a global reach because of the borderless nature of crypto payments. This is particularly beneficial as it gives everyone equal opportunity to access the global gig economy, and most importantly equal opportunity to earn an equivalent wage. 

CANwork is continually being optimised for your experience. We pride ourselves on the fact that CANwork is made from insights from our community. We are a platform for gig workers, designed by gig workers. CANwork has created a suite of free tools which allows a sole operator to build and operate their business from their own computer.
